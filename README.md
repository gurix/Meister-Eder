# Meister-Eder

AI-powered conversational registration system for **Spielgruppe Pumuckl**, a playgroup run by Familienverein Fällanden (Fällanden, Switzerland).

Replaces a static Google Forms workflow with an AI agent that guides parents through child registration via natural conversation — over email or a web chat interface.

## What it does

- Guides parents through registration one question at a time, adapting to their responses
- Answers questions about fees, schedule, and policies from a curated knowledge base
- Validates and stores completed registrations as structured data
- Notifies playgroup administrators on completion, routed by playgroup type
- Supports German and English; defaults to German
